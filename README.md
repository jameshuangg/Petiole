# Petiole

**Why is it called Petiole?**
I called the app Petiole because its synonym is stalk (leaf base).
It sounds similar to stock, which is the intention of my extension.
Stalk is the connection between the leaf and the stem, which can be thought also as the connection between stock prices and a person.

TL;DR: I tried to be cool
